# About Us

## Systems Software & Security Lab

We build practical systems with focuses on security, performance, robustness, or often just for fun. Our research projects have been published in top academic conferences, and have made great impacts on real programs, such as Firefox, Android, and the Linux kernel, that you might be using every day. If you are interested in hacking with us, please drop us an email via [sslab@cc.gatech.edu](mailto:sslab@cc.gatech.edu).
